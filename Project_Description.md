# Project Description

## Project Name
Telemetry Platform – ASP.NET Core & PostgreSQL

---

## Project Description
A backend telemetry platform designed to ingest, store, and query device telemetry data via a RESTful API.  
The system exposes endpoints for creating telemetry events, querying historical data with pagination and filtering, and reporting application health status.

The project is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, enabling a reproducible local environment with a PostgreSQL database.  
It demonstrates clean API design, reliable database interaction using Entity Framework Core, and production-style backend setup.
